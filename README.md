# Project Description
This is a machine learning project for the AAU course: Machine Learning for Media Experiences. 

The project attempts to satisfy the following criteria:
* The data must be analyzed using, e.g., visualization, clustering, PCA, intra/inter class distances, and the possibility for dimensionality reduction should be investigated.
* A number of different methods must be chosen (e.g., nearest neighbour, naïve Bayes, quadratic, linear), motivated, and applied to the assigned classification problem.
* All methods must be tested and compared thoroughly, and conclusions about the data and the problem must be made based on the experiments.
